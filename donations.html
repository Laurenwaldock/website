            <h2>Supporters</h2>
            <p>Hello and thank you all contour 556 supporters.</p>

            <p>We closed our first fundraising campaign through chuffed on 26th June 2021.</p>

            <p>We received $9150 through the platform and a further $6600 directly. That is a great start for the 2022 event and it is wonderful to have support from such a wide group of people, some of whom we haven't met yet!</p>
