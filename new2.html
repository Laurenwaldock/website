            <h3>21 October - 13 November 2016</h3>
            <p>LAKE BURLEY GRIFFIN

                The inaugural contour 556 intervention into the Canberra landscape ran from 21 October – 13 November 2016.</p>

            <p>Contour 556 was curated by Neil Hobbs, with assistance from the contour 556 team: Karina Harris, Jordan Evans-Tse, Bronwyn Blake and Georgia Hobbs.</p>

            <p>The inaugural Contour 556 was a case study for Neil’s PhD research project on ‘the transformative nature of public art on the public realm.’ Artworks and performances linked in some way to Canberra’s cultural and political history.</p>

            <p> Contour 556 saw 41 artworks and performances by 48 local, national and international artists installed on the lake shore and around the Kingston Arts Precinct. The artworks transformed iconic designed landscapes within the central lake area such as Bowen Park, Central Basin, The National Library foyer and forecourt, the National Gallery of Australia Sculpture Garden, Megalo Print Studios and the Fitters Workshop. The artworks included light, sound and digital projections and added vibrancy to the lake edge and parkland. One of the works, Katy Mutton’s dazzle camouflage boat ‘In Plain Sight’ will remain visible on Lake Burley Griffin (and available for hire by the public) for 12 months.</p>

            <p> Of the 48 participating artists 33 were from the Canberra region, 13 from Brisbane, Tweed Heads, Sydney, Southern Highlands or Melbourne, and 2 international artists, from China and Germany.</p>
